# Portfolio (WIP)

This is my software engineer portfolio website with publically-available code for review. Check out the site itself at (TBD) then poke around the code a bit to see how I built it.

## Isn't This a Bit... Over-Engineered?

Yes, it absolutely is, but as I'm attempting to demonstrate some of my skills, I decided to build it as if it was a much larger app. It probably doesn't need 5 projects and its own database, but look at how neat it is! :D

## The Site Looks Sort of Basic

Yeah... I used Material UI to help, but the simple fact of the matter is: I'm blind. I have no useful vision, as in the world is nothing but indistinct grayscale blobs with bright, painful lights sometimes. I do my best organizing UIs with what i know about positioning and colors and such, but I simply can't see the result. So, I am full stack; I can build functional, efficient, and accessible interfaces, but just don't ask me to make anything look slick or modern or whatever the popular words are right now. I'll hand that part off to a more front-end focused, design-minded teammate; we can't all do it all!
